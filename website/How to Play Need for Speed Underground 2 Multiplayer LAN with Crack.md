## What You Need
 
Before you start, make sure you have the following things ready:
 
- A copy of Need for Speed Underground 2 installed on your PC. You can download it from various sources online, but make sure it is virus-free and compatible with your system.
- A patch to update the game to version 1.2. You can download it from [the official website](https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-underground-2) or other trusted sites.
- A crack to bypass the CD check and enable multiplayer LAN mode. You can find it on various websites, but be careful of malware and fake links. One possible source is [this one](https://sway.office.com/fGsKSqPwu5RqAjZz), which claims to have a working crack for version 1.2.
- A LAN network with your friends who also have the game installed and patched. You can use a physical cable, a wireless router, or a virtual network software like Hamachi, Tunngle, or GameRanger.

## What You Do
 
Once you have everything ready, follow these steps to play Need for Speed Underground 2 multiplayer LAN with crack:

1. Install the patch to update the game to version 1.2. Follow the instructions on the screen and restart your PC if needed.
2. Copy the crack file to the game folder, replacing the original speed2.exe file. Make sure you backup the original file in case something goes wrong.
3. Edit the server.cfg file in the game folder with a text editor like Notepad. Find the line that says ADDR=%%bind ("159.153.253.82") and add a # symbol in front of it, so it looks like this: #ADDR=%%bind ("159.153.253.82"). This will prevent the game from connecting to EA servers and allow LAN mode.
4. Save and close the server.cfg file.
5. Run the game as administrator by right-clicking on the speed2.exe file and choosing Run as administrator. You might also need to change the compatibility mode to Windows XP Service Pack 3 by right-clicking on the file, choosing Properties, clicking on Compatibility tab, and checking the box next to Run this program in compatibility mode for.
6. In the game menu, choose LAN Play and create or join a server with your friends. Enjoy!

## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any problems while playing Need for Speed Underground 2 multiplayer LAN with crack, here are some possible solutions:

- If you get an error message saying "Please insert correct CD-ROM", make sure you copied the crack file correctly and run the game as administrator.
- If you can't see any servers or join any games, make sure you and your friends have the same game version (1.2) and crack file. Also check your firewall settings and port forwarding options if you are using a virtual network software.
- If you experience lag or slow loading times, try lowering your graphics settings and closing any background programs that might affect your performance.

## Conclusion
 
Need for Speed Underground 2 is a classic racing game that can be enjoyed even more with multiplayer LAN mode. With a few simple steps and tools, you can play Need for Speed Underground 2 multiplayer LAN with crack without needing the original game disc.
